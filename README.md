# edhMonitor
A simple app Iâ€™m using at my house to monitor the status of the edh (main power in Haiti) and the status of my generator.

# Setup
The app is built on top of blynk: https://blynk.io/
Which is a free platform that lets you interact with IOT
Required materials:
- 1 node mcu
- 3 120v relays
Cabling to do the installation

# Double throw setup
The double throw is setup like this:
- A cable that goes straight from the edh in to a power outlet
- A cable that goes straight from the generator in to a power outlet
- A cable that goes straight from the main out to a power outlet
